## Briefly about myself:

I began exploring programming in my childhood, initially trying out courses in C language. Iâ€™ve also invested a lot of time in design, focusing on Adobe Photoshop and experimenting with 3D modeling in Cinema 4D, as well as learning video editing in Adobe Premiere.

After graduating from high school, I entered college to study programming. Throughout my studies, I worked on various projects, from mobile applications to desktop software. However, web development was where I found my true interest. For my diploma project, I created an online clothing store, bringing together my design and development skills in a project I was passionate about. Here's the link: [UNDERBRIDGE](https://underbridge.netlify.app/).

All this experience helped me develop teamwork skills and introduced me to several programming languages, libraries, and frameworks. My strength has been the ability to learn quickly and build a project without prior knowledge, using various resources from video guides on YouTube to solutions from Stack Overflow. 

I aim to build a solid foundation for future learning and to start my journey as a Junior Front-End Developer.
